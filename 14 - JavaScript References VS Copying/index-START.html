    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    // makes a copy
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2);
    age = 200;
    console.log(age)

    let name = 'wes';
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2);
    name = 'wesley';
    console.log(name, name2)


    // Let's say we have an array
    // arrays reference the array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team)

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux'

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // array reference, not an array copy.

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    //if pass nothing in slice, will pass a copy of the actual array
    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    //another option
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    //spread content into whatever is containing it
    const team4 = [...players];

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;
    //this changes the original array too

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99, age: 12})
    console.log(cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread (this is now added)
    const cap3 = {...person}
    console.log(cap3)

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    //only clones one level deep using object.assign, if you change something that is deeper than one level then it is a reference to the original, and will change it.
    const wes = {
      name: 'wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    }
    console.clear();
    console.log(wes);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);

    //this would make what is called a poor man's deep clone, works 
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
